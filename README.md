AVAILABLE FEATURES

This implementation of the Game of Life uses a 20x50 grid and allows the user to Start and Pause the simulation. Additionally, there is a Step button to step forward just one generation, a Random Start button to re-populate the grid with random values and restart the Generation count, and a Clean button that removes all alive cells. These features are illustrated in the following GIF.
