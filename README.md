AVAILABLE FEATURES

This implementation of the Game of Life uses a 20x50 grid and allows the user to Start and Pause the simulation. Additionally, there is a Step button to step forward just one generation, a Random Start button to re-populate the grid with random values and restart the Generation count, and a Clean button that removes all alive cells. These features are illustrated in the following GIF.

Additionally, the user can toggle the state of any of the cells by clicking on them. Using this feature, the user can draw and test any pattern.
